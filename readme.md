Taking a dataset on Electric power consumption (from "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/") we aim to construct 4 charts.
Our overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. The task is to reconstruct 4 plots, all of which using the base plotting system.
We have 1 R script for reading and cleaning data, plus selecting it
Then 4 R scripts, one for each chart
And the 4 charts themselves
