This is the readme file for assignment number 1 on Exploratory Data Analysis course at Coursera.

Taking a dataset on Electric power consumption (from "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/") we aim to construct 4 charts.

Our overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. The task is to reconstruct 4 plots, all of which using the base plotting system.
We have 1 R script for reading and cleaning data, plus doing a selection on it:
- read.clean.data.for.plots.R

Then 4 R scripts, one for each chart
- plot1.R
- plot2.R
- plot3.R
- plot4.R

And the 4 plots themselves:
- plot1.png
- plot2.png
- plot3.png
- plot4.png
